# Hi, I'm Evonne Aguirre 👋

I'm a PhD student studying plant ecophysiology, currently working on designing and deploying a low-cost sap flow sensor for ecosystem research. 🌳💧

🔬 My interests include:
- Tree hydraulics and microclimate interactions
- Plant physiology
- Science communication and open-source tools

🛠 Current project:
- 🌡 [CUNY Sap Flow Sensor Project](https://github.com/eaguirre12/CUNY-Js5): Arduino-based sap flow sensor and data logger

📚 Other stuff I like:
- Fieldwork with big trees
- Teaching biology labs
- Making science more accessible

Thanks for stopping by!
