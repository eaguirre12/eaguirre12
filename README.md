# Hi, I'm [Your Name] ðŸ‘‹

I'm a PhD student studying plant ecophysiology, currently working on designing and deploying a low-cost sap flow sensor for ecosystem research. ðŸŒ³ðŸ’§

ðŸ”¬ My interests include:
- Tree hydraulics and microclimate interactions
- Plant physiology
- Science communication and open-source tools

ðŸ›  Current project:
- ðŸŒ¡ [CUNY Sap Flow Sensor Project](https://github.com/eaguirre12/CUNY-Js5): Arduino-based sap flow sensor and data logger

ðŸ“š Other stuff I like:
